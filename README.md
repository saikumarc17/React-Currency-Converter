This project is a powerful currency converter built using React.js. It showcases the use of reusable components, custom hooks, and several React hooks including useState, useCallback, and useId.

## Features

- **Reusable Components**: The application is built with reusability in mind. Components are designed to be reusable, making the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and easy to maintain.
- **Custom Hooks**: The application demonstrates how to create and use custom hooks for abstracting component logic, leading to cleaner and more readable components.
- **React Hooks**: The application makes extensive use of React hooks including useState for state management, useCallback for memoizing functions, and useId for generating unique IDs.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: The application is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Hooks**: The application uses several React hooks including useState, useCallback, and useId.
- **Tailwind CSS**: The application uses CSS for styling and creating a responsive design.
- **API**: The application fetches the latest exchange rates from a exchangerate-api.

## How to Use

To use the application, simply select the currency you want to convert from, enter the amount, and select the currency you want to convert to. The application will display the converted amount in real-time.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding a feature to save favorite currency pairs for quick access.
- Implementing historical data charts to visualize the fluctuation of exchange rates over time.
